## Introduction

## Scope

In this challenge, as a data analyst working for a nonprofit foundation, **Alphabet Soup**, are seeking experties to build a model that selects the applicant with the best chance of success in their ventures.

From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organisation, such as:
  
        - **EIN and NAME:** Identification columns
        - APPLICANT_TYPE: Alphabet Soup Application type
        - AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry
        - CLASSIFICATION: Government organisation classification
        - USE_CASE: Use case for funding
        - ORGANIZATION: Organisation type
        - STATUS: Active status
        - INCOME_AMT: Income classification
        - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for application
        - ASK_AMT: Funding amount requested
        - IS_SUCCESSFUL: Was the money used effectively

### Goal

The overall goal of this analysis is to implement the foundational knowledge of `Machine Learning` and `Neural Networks`, to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by the nonprofit foundation, **Alphabet Soup**.
